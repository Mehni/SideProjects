    <BaseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef]'s noble family did not want [PAWN_objective], but could not afford to be seen directly assassinating [PAWN_objective] either. They attempted to get [PAWN_objective] killed by assigning [PAWN_objective] dangerous training without proper protection at too young an age.
\nAgainst all odds, [PAWN_nameDef] survived the jousting contests, horsewar matches, riverrun competitions and warzones. In the end, it only made [PAWN_objective] stronger.</BaseDesc>
